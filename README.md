# plant_app
This app is still in the works and open for assistance. This is a simple collection app where users will log in(or sign up) and will then proceed to select what plants they own, and share with others. Eventually I want to implement a chat feature where users can interact with one another. E.g. - sharing plant care tips, collection, etc.
